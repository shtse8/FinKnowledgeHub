# Financial Instruments

Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties that can be created, traded, modified, and settled. They represent a spectrum of assets and agreements that form the foundation of modern financial markets.

They range from traditional instruments like stocks and bonds to complex derivatives and structured products. Understanding the characteristics, functions, and risks of various financial instruments is essential for effective participation in financial markets.
