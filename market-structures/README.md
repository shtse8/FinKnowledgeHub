# Market Structures

Market structures refer to the organization, operation, and interaction of financial markets, including their participants, regulations, and mechanisms for price discovery and trade execution.

## Overview

Financial markets are complex systems where various securities are traded, capital is allocated, and economic resources are priced. Understanding the structures of these markets is essential for investors, traders, regulators, and financial professionals to navigate the global financial system effectively.

## Historical Development

Financial markets have evolved significantly over time:

- **Ancient markets**: Early commodity and debt trading in civilizations like Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome
- **Medieval markets**: Development of trade fairs, banking in Italian city-states, and early futures contracts
- **17th-18th centuries**: Establishment of formal stock exchanges in Amsterdam, London, and later New York
- **19th-20th centuries**: Expansion of exchanges, introduction of regulations, and development of new financial instruments
- **Late 20th century**: Computerization and electronic trading
- **21st century**: Algorithmic trading, dark pools, decentralized finance, and global market integration
