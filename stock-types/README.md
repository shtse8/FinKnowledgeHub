# Stock Types

Stocks represent ownership interests in companies and come in various types, each with distinct characteristics, rights, and purposes.

## Overview

Stocks (also known as equities or shares) represent fractional ownership in a corporation. Different types of stocks offer varying levels of ownership rights, income potential, risk profiles, and growth prospects. Understanding these differences is crucial for investors to build portfolios aligned with their financial goals.

## Historical Development

The concept of shared ownership in business ventures dates back to ancient Rome, but the modern stock market began with the establishment of the Dutch East India Company in 1602, which issued the world's first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Stock markets evolved significantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, with the New York Stock Exchange established in 1792. The 20th century saw further innovations in stock types and trading mechanisms, while the 21st century has introduced electronic trading, algorithmic trading, and new stock classifications.
