# Common Stock

Common stock represents the most fundamental form of equity ownership in a corporation, providing shareholders with voting rights and potential financial rewards through capital appreciation and dividends.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Evolution

The concept of shared ownership in business enterprises dates back thousands of years:

- **Ancient Rome (c. 200 BCE)**: The societates publicanorum were early examples of companies that issued shares to investors.
- **Medieval Italy (12th-13th centuries)**: Italian merchant banks and maritime ventures used share-based structures to distribute risk.
- **1602**: The Dutch East India Company (VOC) issued the first shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, creating the first formal stock market.
- **17th-18th centuries**: Joint-stock companies proliferated in England and other European countries.
- **1792**: The Buttonwood Agreement established what would become the New York Stock Exchange.
- **19th century**: Limited liability became a standard feature of common stock, protecting shareholders from company debts.
- **20th century**: Stock ownership expanded from wealthy individuals to the general public, with significant growth after World War II.
- **Late 20th-21st centuries**: Electronic trading, retirement accounts, and index funds democratized common stock ownership further.

## Common Stock in Corporate Structure

### Position in Capital Stack

Common stock typically sits at the bottom of the corporate capital structure:

```
[Most Senior]
1. Secured Debt
2. Unsecured Debt
3. Preferred Stock
4. Common Stock
[Most Junior]
```

This position means:
- Higher risk compared to debt and preferred stock
- Higher potential return to compensate for increased risk
- Last to receive payment in case of bankruptcy or liquidation
- No guarantee of dividends or return of principal

## Financial Aspects

### Valuation Methods

Common stock is valued using several methods:

- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**: Estimates the present value of expected future cash flows
- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Compares share price to earnings per share
- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Compares share price to book value per share
- **Dividend Discount Model**: Values stock based on expected future dividends
- **Comparable Company Analysis**: Uses valuation multiples of similar companies

### Performance Metrics

Key metrics for evaluating common stock:

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Net income divided by outstanding shares
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Net income divided by shareholders' equity
- **Dividend Yield**: Annual dividends per share divided by share price
- **Beta**: Measure of volatility relative to the overall market
- **Market Capitalization**: Total value of all outstanding shares

### Dividend Policies

Common approaches to dividend distribution:

- **Regular dividends**: Consistent, periodic payments
- **Special dividends**: One-time distributions, often after exceptional earnings
- **Dividend growth**: Strategy of regular increases in dividend payments
- **Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs)**: Programs allowing automatic reinvestment of dividends
- **No dividends**: Retention of all earnings for growth (common in tech and growth companies)

## Common Stock Trading

### Primary Market

First issuance of common stock to the public occurs through:

- **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)**: First sale of stock to the public
- **Direct Listings**: Alternative to IPOs where existing shares are listed directly
- **Follow-on Offerings**: Additional stock issuance after IPO
- **Rights Offerings**: Offering of shares to existing shareholders

### Secondary Market

After initial issuance, common stock trades on exchanges or OTC markets:

- **Stock Exchanges**: Centralized venues like NYSE, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange
- **Over-the-Counter (OTC)**: Decentralized market for less liquid stocks
- **Dark Pools**: Private exchanges for anonymous trading
- **Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)**: Computerized systems matching buy and sell orders

### Ownership Structures

## Corporate Actions Affecting Common Stock

### Events Impacting Shareholders

- **Mergers and acquisitions**: Combination or purchase of companies, often affecting share value

## Tax Considerations

### Tax Treatment in the United States
