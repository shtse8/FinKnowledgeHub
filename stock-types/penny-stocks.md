# Penny Stocks

Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies that typically trade outside the major market exchanges. Generally defined as stocks trading below $5 per share, penny stocks offer both extraordinary profit potential and significant risks for investors willing to venture into the highly speculative end of the equity market.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Evolution

The concept of penny stocks has existed since the early days of public equity markets, with their popularity fluctuating throughout financial history:

- **Early 20th Century**: Low-priced stocks became popular during speculative periods, notably in mining and oil exploration ventures
- **Post-1929 Crash Era**: New regulations were introduced following abuses in the penny stock market that contributed to the 1929 market crash
- **1980s-1990s**: Penny stock fraud reached its peak, inspiring stricter regulations and the 1990 Penny Stock Reform Act
- **Early 2000s**: Internet trading platforms democratized access to penny stocks, leading to both increased participation and new forms of manipulation
- **2010s-Present**: Social media and online forums created new dynamics in penny stock trading, with coordinated retail investor activity occasionally driving significant price movements

### Regulatory Evolution

The regulatory framework for penny stocks has evolved significantly:

- **Securities Act of 1933**: Established basic disclosure requirements for all publicly traded securities
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: Created the SEC and foundation for modern securities regulation
- **Securities Acts Amendments of 1975**: Established framework for a national market system
- **Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990**: Mandated enhanced disclosure requirements for penny stock transactions
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002**: Increased reporting requirements affecting even smaller issuers
- **JOBS Act of 2012**: Created some exemptions for smaller companies while maintaining investor protections

## Valuation Approaches

Valuing penny stocks presents unique challenges and requires specialized approaches:

### Traditional Financial Metrics

- **Potential Acquisition Value**: Worth to potential strategic buyers
