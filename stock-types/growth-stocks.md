# Growth Stocks

Growth stocks are shares in companies that are expected to increase their revenue, earnings, and ultimately, their share price at a rate significantly above the market average or their industry peers. Investors purchase growth stocks for their capital appreciation potential rather than dividend income.

## Historical Development

### Origins and Evolution

The concept of growth investing has evolved significantly over time:

- **1930s-1940s**: The foundations of growth investing began to form as analysts like T. Rowe Price Jr. started distinguishing between different types of stocks based on their future prospects rather than just current values.
- **1951**: T. Rowe Price Jr. established the first growth-focused mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.
- **1950s-1960s**: The "Nifty Fifty" era saw investors flock to high-growth companies believed to be "one-decision stocks" (buy and never sell).
- **1980s-1990s**: The technology boom brought a new generation of growth stocks, with computing and software companies leading the way.
- **Late 1990s**: The dot-com bubble represented an extreme period of growth stock speculation.
- **2000s-2010s**: After the dot-com crash, growth investing became more disciplined, with greater attention to business fundamentals and reasonable valuations.
- **2010s-Present**: The rise of technology-driven disruptors created a new wave of growth stocks, with many commanding premium valuations based on their scalable business models and network effects.

## Valuation Approaches

### Growth Stock Valuation Methods

Valuing growth stocks requires different approaches than traditional value investing:

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
- Projects future free cash flows based on growth assumptions
- Discounts these cash flows to present value
- Highly sensitive to assumptions about long-term growth rates and discount rates
- Often includes terminal value representing post-high-growth period

#### Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) Ratio
- Compares P/E ratio to earnings growth rate
- PEG = P/E Ratio รท Annual EPS Growth Rate
- Traditional benchmark: PEG < 1.0 may indicate undervaluation
- Accounts for growth in a way simple P/E ratios don't

#### Revenue Multiple Analysis
- Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio comparison
- Useful for pre-profit companies
- Compares P/S to growth rate and industry benchmarks
- Often combined with gross margin analysis

#### Rule of 40
- For software/SaaS companies
- Combined percentage of revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40%
- Balances growth and profitability considerations

#### Comparable Company Analysis
- Compares multiples to similar growth companies
- Adjusts for differences in growth rates, margins, and risk
- Uses metrics like EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E with growth adjustments
