# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis.

## Overview

Technical indicators are tools used by traders to gain insight into price action, identify trends, spot potential reversals, and make trading decisions. These indicators process raw market data (price, volume, etc.) through various mathematical formulas to provide signals or visualizations that can be interpreted for trading purposes.

## History

Technical analysis and indicators have roots dating back to the 18th century with the development of candlestick charting by Japanese rice traders. Modern technical analysis began in the late 19th century with Charles Dow's writings, which later formed the basis of Dow Theory. The advent of computers in the mid-20th century revolutionized technical analysis, allowing for more complex calculations and real-time application of indicators.

## Using Technical Indicators

Most traders use a combination of indicators from different categories to confirm signals and improve accuracy. It's generally not recommended to rely on a single indicator for trading decisions.

Common approaches include:
- Using trend indicators to determine the overall market direction
- Adding momentum indicators to identify strength or weakness
- Confirming signals with volume indicators
- Setting stop-loss levels with volatility indicators
- Identifying potential reversal points with support/resistance indicators

## Limitations

Technical indicators have several limitations:
- They are based on historical data and may not predict future movements accurately
- Different indicators can provide conflicting signals
- They may perform better in certain market conditions than others
- Overreliance on indicators can lead to "analysis paralysis"
- Most indicators are lagging rather than leading
